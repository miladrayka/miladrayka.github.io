**RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**

**Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Research Center of Iran, Tehran, Iran**  2018-2022

**Ph.D. Research**

**Supervisior**: Dr. Rohoullah Firouzi

**Advisor**: Dr. M. H. Karimi-Jafari

**Project**: Ligand and Protein Interaction Prediction Using Machine Learning

-   **Results**: A new method for generating features based on distance-weighted interatomic contacts is presented, which is coupled with machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Gradient Boosting Trees for predicting binding affinity in protein-ligand complexes. Additionally, a user-friendly software called 3S Application is introduced to facilitate the design of scoring functions for users without programming experience.
-   Articles have been published by Molecular Informatics.

**Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran**  2015-2017

**M.Sc. Research**

**Supervisior**: Dr. Shant Shahbazian

**Project**: Development of effective electronic structure theory for Muonic moleculer systems: Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Shams equations

-   **Results**: In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where nuclei are stationary, quantum behavior in nuclei or particles like muons cannot be studied. To study these effects, we utilize the nuclear-electronic orbital method in both Hartree-Fock and density functional theory frameworks. We derive non-Coulombic potentials that can be incorporated into Hartree-Fock and density functional theory equations to describe the quantum effects of these particles.
-   Articles have been published by Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics.
